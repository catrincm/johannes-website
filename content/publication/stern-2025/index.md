abstract: "In this paper we show how to introduce a conditional to Kripke's theory of truth that respects the deduction theorem for the consequence relation associated with the theory. To this effect we develop a novel supervaluational framework, called strong Kleene supervaluation, that we take to be a promising framework for handling the truth-conditions of non-monotone notion in the presence of semantic indeterminacy more generally."

#Summary. A shortened abstract for the summary pages.
