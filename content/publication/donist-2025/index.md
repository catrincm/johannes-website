abstract: "Supervaluational fixed-point semantics for truth cannot be axiomatized because of its recursion-theoretic complexity. Johannes Stern (_Supervaluation-Style Truth Without Supervaluations_, Journal of Philosophical Logic, 2018) proposed a new strategy (supervaluational-style truth) to capture the essential aspects of the supervaluational evaluation schema whilst limiting its recursion-theoretic complexity, hence resulting in ($\nat$-categorical) axiomatizations. Unfortunately, as we show in the paper, this strategy was not fully realized in Stern's original work: in fact, we provide counterexamples to some of Stern's key claims. However,  we also vindicate Stern's project by providing different semantic incarnations of the idea and corresponding $\nat$-categorical axiomatizations. The results provide a deeper picture of the relationships between standard supervaluationism and supervaluational-style truth."

#Summary. A shortened abstract for the summary pages.
summary: "The paper revisits some ideas discussed in Johannes Stern's paper _Supervaluation-style Truth Without Supervaluations_ and corrects some mistakes of the original paper."
