abstract: "Since Montague’s work it is well known that treating a single modality as
a predicate may lead to paradox. In their paper “No Future”, Horsten and Leitgeb
(2001) show that if the two temporal modalities are treated as predicates paradox
might arise as well. In our paper we investigate whether paradoxes of multiple modalities, such as the No Future paradox, are genuinely new paradoxes or whether they
“reduce” to the paradoxes of single modalities. In order to address this question
we develop a notion of reducibility based on a version of Smorynski Diagonalized
Operator Logic. We show that there are reducible multimodal paradoxes as well as
irreducible paradoxes of interaction. In particular, we show the No Future paradox to
be an irreducible paradox according to our notion of reducibility.
