abstract: "We discuss the interplay between the axiomatic and the semantic approach to truth.
Often, semantic constructions have guided the development of axiomatic theories and certain
axiomatic theories have been claimed to capture a semantic construction. We ask under which
conditions an axiomatic theory captures a semantic construction. After discussing some potential
criteria, we focus on the criterion of N-categoricity and discuss its usefulness and limits."
