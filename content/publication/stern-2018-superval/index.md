abstract: "
  Kripke’s theory of truth is arguably the most influential approach to self-
  referential truth and the semantic paradoxes. The use of a partial evaluation scheme
  is crucial to the theory and the most prominent schemes that are adopted are the
  strong Kleene and the supervaluation scheme.

  The strong Kleene scheme is attractive
  because it ensures the compositionality of the notion of truth. But under the strong
  Kleene scheme classical tautologies do not, in general, turn out to be true and, as
  a consequence, classical reasoning is no longer admissible once the notion of truth
  is involved.

  The supervaluation scheme adheres to classical reasoning but violates
  compositionality. Moreover, it turns Kripke’s theory into a rather complicated affair:
  to check whether a sentence is true we have to look at all admissible precisification
  of the interpretation of the truth predicate we are presented with. One consequence of
  this complicated evaluation condition is that under the supervaluation scheme a more
  proof-theoretic characterization of Kripke’s theory becomes inherently difficult, if
  not impossible.

  In this paper we explore the middle ground between the strong Kleene
  and the supervaluation scheme and provide an evaluation scheme that adheres to
  classical reasoning but retains many of the attractive features of the strong Kleene
  scheme.  We supplement our semantic investigation with a novel axiomatic theory of
  truth that matches the semantic theory we have put forth.
