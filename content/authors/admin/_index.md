I am a Research Fellow at the [Department of Philosophy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy) of the University of Bristol, where I have a permanent position.
I am also the Principal Investigator of the project [Truth and Semantics](https://truthandsemantics.xyz/) funded by an [ERC Starting Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants).

I specialize mostly in logic, in particular theories of truth and modality, and topics at the intersection of logic and the philosophy of language. I am also interested in the philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology and general philosophy of science.
