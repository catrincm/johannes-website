I am currently a Research Fellow and a permanent member of staff at the [Department of Philosophy of the University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy).

I am also the PI of the project Truth and Semantics funded by an ERC Starting Grant.

Previously, I held positions as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellow in Bristol and as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy](http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) (LMU Munich).
