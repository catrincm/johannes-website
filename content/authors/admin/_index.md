I am a Research Fellow at the [Department of Philosophy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy) of the University of Bristol, where I have a permanent position.

I am also the Principal Investigator of the project [Truth and Semantics](https://truthandsemantics.netlify.app/) funded by an [ERC Starting Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants).
